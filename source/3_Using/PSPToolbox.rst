    Fig. 3.13 Relationship between Simulink and Pixhawk autopilot code generation

Figure 3.13 shows the relationship among the PSP toolbox, the PX4 software, and
the Pixhawk hardware. The main features of the toolbox are summarized below.

(1). The toolbox can simulate and test different multicopter models and flight control
algorithms in Simulink and then automatically deploy the algorithms to the
Pixhawk autopilot.

(2). The toolbox provides many practical examples, including LED control, RC data
process, and attitude controller.

(3). The toolbox provides many interface modules to access the Pixhawk hardware
and software components.

(4). It automatically records flight data from sensors, actuators, and controllers
deployed by themselves.

(5). It can subscribe and publish uORB topic messages. All messages in the PX4
autopilot software are temporarily stored in a uORB message pool. The subscription 
function can read topics of interest from the message pool, and the
publishing function can publish specific topics to the message pool for other
modules.

The relationship between the code generated by Simulink and the Pixhawk autopilot system is summarized below.

(1). The structure of a Pixhawk autopilot system includes two parts, namely the
Pixhawk hardware (similar to the computer hardware) and the PX4 software
(similar to the operating system and applications running on a computer).

(2) The PX4 software system can be further divided into several small modules,
which run independently in parallel multi-thread. Each module exchanges data
with other modules through the subscription and publication of uORB messages.

(3). After the algorithm code is generated by the PSP toolbox, it is embedded into
the PX4 software system. This will not affect the operation of the native control
modules in the PX4 software. Instead, a new independent module (with an independent 
thread) named “px4_simulink_app” will be created to run in parallel
with other modules.

(4). As shown in Fig. 3.13, the whole code generation and deployment procedures
are presented as follows.

    1). The PSP toolbox generates the C/C++ code from the control algorithm
    designed in Simulink.

    2). The obtained algorithm code is imported into the PX4 source code to generate
    a “px4_simulink_app” independent of other modules.

    3). The PSP toolbox calls the compiling toolchain (Win10WSL, Msys2, or Cygwin) 
    to compile all the code into a “.px4” PX4 firmware file (similar to a
    software installation package).

    4). Upload the obtained firmware file to the Pixhawk hardware; then, the Pixhawk
    autopilot can execute the PX4 software with the generated algorithm code.

(5). The native modules in the PX4 software may assess the same hardware outputs as the generated “px4_simulink_app” module, which may cause read and
write conflicts. Therefore, in the one-key installation script, the hardware output
accessing codes of the PX4 native modules have been blocked in the last option
shown in Fig. 2.4. This will ensure that only the “px4_simulink_app” module
can send motor control signals.

        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.14 Relationship between PX4 native modules and module generated by Simulink

(6). The generated Simulink code can also be used to replace some of the native
modules (sensors, filters, attitude controllers, etc.) of the PX4 software shown
in Fig. 3.13. However, the PX4 software code needs to be manually modified to
block the output interface of the corresponding native module (Another feasible
way is to block the module in the startup script “Firmware\ROMFS\px4fmu_common\init.d\rcS”). 
For example, if readers want to use Simulink to replace
the filter module (input sensor data, output filter data) of the PX4 software, they
should manually block uORB publishing code of the PX4 “Position and Attitude
Estimator” module in Fig. 3.14 to prevent it from publishing estimate data. The
detailed steps are described next.

    1). Open the “Firmware\ src\modules\ekf2\ekf2_main.cpp” file (corresponding to the code of the extended Kalman filter module).
    
    2). Search for the text “orb_publish_auto(ORB_ID(vehicle_attitude)” and comment out the related code.



Simulink Pixhawk Target Blocks Library of PSP Toolbox
--------------------------------------------------------

As shown in Fig. 3.15, after installing the PSP toolbox, a “Pixhawk Target Blocks”
interface module library can be found in the Simulink library browser. These modules
provide interfaces to access the Pixhawk hardware I/Os and the PX4 internal messages. 
The “Pixhawk Target Blocks” library consists of four sub-libraries, namely “ADC and 
Serial library”, “Miscellaneous Utility Blocks” library, “Sensors and Actuators” 
library, and “uORB Read and Write” library.

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.15.jpg

        Fig. 3.15 Simulink PSP module library

Figure 3.16 presents several key I/O interface modules in the “Sensors and Actuators” 
library. These modules make it easy to acquire the sensor data or estimate data
for designing flight controllers that compute output signals for the motors, LEDs,
and buzzers.

As shown in Fig. 3.17, the PSP toolbox also provides many examples
(see folder “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps”) with an official manual (see document
“e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\Pixhawk_Pilot_Support_Package.pdf” for details) for 
readers to be quickly familiar with functions and usage methods of PSP toolbox.

Instructions for Modules in PSP Toolbox
------------------------------------------

(1). RC input module

Figure 3.18 presents the RC input module and its parameter setting box. It is 
convenient to select RC channels and other information to be used by Simulink. The
definition and application of each option can be viewed by clicking the “help”
button of the box or by consulting the official PDF document. The PSP toolbox
also provides an example ( see file“e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_input_rc.
slx”) to show how to use this module.

(2). PWM output module

Figure 3.19 depicts the PWM output module, which is used to send PWM
signals to PX4IO ports to control the motor. The PWM update frequency and
the number of output channels can be configured in the setting box.

signals to PX4FMU ports to control the servo deflection. The PWM update
frequency and the number of output channels can be configured in the setting
box.

(4). Buzzer module

Figure 3.21 presents the Buzzer module, which is used when the buzzer
is required to make a warning sound. There is an example (see file
“e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_tune.slx”) for detailed information.

        Fig. 3.21 Buzzer module and its parameter setting box

(5). RGB_LED module

This module can control the blink mode and color of the LED on Pixhawk. As
shown in Fig. 3.22, the module receives two inputs, namely “Mode” and “Color”
representing the mode and color of the LED. The PSP toolbox provides an
example (see file “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_rgbled.slx”) to study this
module.

        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.22 LED light module and its parameter setting box

(6). Sensor combination module

This module can access the sensor data available in the Pixhawk autopilot,
which can then be used for controller design in Simulink. Available sensor data
include magnetometers, accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, and timestamps. 
As shown in Fig. 3.23, the sample rate and the required sensor data
can be configured in the parameter setting box. The PSP toolbox also provides
an example (see file “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_attitude_control.slx”)
to study this module.

        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.23 Sensor combination module and its parameter setting box

(7). Attitude data module

As shown in Fig. 3.24, the attitude data module provides an interface to
access the attitude estimate (Euler angles and quaternion). The PSP toolbox
also provides an example (see file “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_attitude_control.slx”) 
to study this module.

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.24.jpg

(8). GPS data module

This module, shown in Fig. 3.25, can be used to access the Pixhawk GPS data,
which are achieved by subscribing to the uORB topic “vehicle_gps”. Therefore,
in practical operation, it is necessary to ensure that the GPS module is inserted
into the Pixhawk hardware and then works. The PSP toolbox also provides
an example (see file “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_gps.slx”) to study this
module.

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.25.jpg
        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.25 GPS data module and its parameter setting box

(9). Battery data module

This module, shown in 3.26, can be used to obtain the real-time status of the
battery. It is implemented by subscribing to the uORB topic “battery_status”.
Therefore, in practical operation, it is necessary to ensure that the power module
is inserted into the Pixhawk hardware and then works correctly.

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.26.jpg
        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.26 Battery data module and its parameter setting box

(10). uORB modules

These modules, presented in Fig. 3.27, are used to read or write uORB messages
from the PX4 autopilot software. All the uORB message topics supported by
the PX4 autopilot are listed in the directory “Firmware\msg” of the software
package installation directory (configured as in Fig. 2.4; the default directory
is “C:\PX4PSP”).

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.27.jpg
        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.27 uORB modules for message reading and writing


Double-click the “uORB Write” module in Fig. 3.27, then
the obtained parameter setting box of the “uORB Write” module is presented
in Fig. 3.28, where the uORB topic name and the message variables to be sent
can be configured. 

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.28.jpg
        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.28 “uORB Write” module parameter setting box

Clicking the “Open .msg file” button in Fig. 3.28 yields the
content of the select “.msg” file (see Fig. 3.29), and clicking the “Open .msg
folder” button yields the list of all supported uORB messages (See Fig. 3.30).

        :align: center

        Fig. 3.30 Pop-up window of “Open .msg folder” button

There are two advanced “uORB Write” modules presented in Fig. 3.31, which
provide more convenient ways to send uORB messages.

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.31.jpg
        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.31 Advanced “uORB Write” modules and difference between them

In fact, all modules (PWM output, RGB_LED, etc.) mentioned in this section
are implemented at the underlying code by reading and writing uORB messages. 
Theoretically, by using the “uORB Read and Write” modules, all messages and 
intermediate variables used in the PX4 autopilot can be accessed
by Simulink. This simplifies the implementation of more advanced functions
for controller design. The PSP toolbox also provides two examples (see
file “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_fcn_call_uorb_example.slx”, and file
“e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_write_uorb_example.slx”) to study this
module.

In the PX4 development website, there are detailed documents for creating a
`new uORB message <http://dev.px4.io/master/en/middleware/uorb.html>`_ and receiving a `new MAVLink message <http://dev.px4.io/master/en/middleware/mavlink.html>`_ to communicate
with external devices. In addition to the uORB modules presented in Fig. 3.27,
it is convenient for the Simulink controller “px4_simulink_app” to exchange
data with external devices, such as cameras, sensors, and host computers.

(11). Accessing PX4 internal parameters

For the sake of convenience for controller parameter tuning in flight tests, the
PSP Toolbox also provides interfaces to access the PX4 internal parameters. In
this way, the parameters of the controller generated by Simulink can be tuned
online in the GCS software, instead of modifying the controller parameters in
Simulink, generating code, and uploading the firmware file again. As shown in
Fig. 3.32, an example of how to access the PX4 internal parameters is presented
in file “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_Parameter_CSC_example.slx”.

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.32.jpg
        :align: center

        :align: center
    
        Fig. 3.33 Simulink initialization script for accessing PX4 parameters

PX4 internal parameter access is realized by using the function
“Pixhawk_CSC.Parameter( {`*`, `*`})”, which needs to be called in the Simulink 
initialization function ( click “Simple”—“Model Properties”—“Callbacks”—“InitFcn”
in the Simulink menu bar). For the example shown in Fig. 3.32, the corresponding
parameter initialization script is shown in Fig. 3.33.



Simulink Configuration for Code Generation of PSP Toolbox
-----------------------------------------------------------

(1). Preparation of the Simulink controller for code generation
The preparation procedure is described below.

1). As shown in Fig. 3.7, design a controller in Simulink and verify it with SIL simulations.

2). Copy the verified controller to a new Simulink file.

3). Connect the input and output ports of the controller subsystem with the input
(e.g., combined sensor module and RC input module) and output (e.g., PWM
module and uORB modules) interface modules in the PSP module library
presented in Fig. 3.15.

4). An example of the obtained Simulink controller file is presented in Fig. 3.34.
The example file is available in “e0\2.PSPOfficialExps\px4demo_attitude_system.slx”.

        Fig. 3.34 Example of Simulink controller connecting with PSP modules

(2). Open the Simulink setting panel

The new created Simulink file must be configured to support the code generation
function of the PSP toolbox. First of all, as shown in Fig. 3.35, the Simulink
setting panel can be opened by clicking “Simulation”—“Model Configuration
Parameters” in the Simulink menu bar.

        Fig. 3.35 Simulink “Settings” button for different MATLAB versions

(3). Setting for PSP code generation

As indicated in Fig. 3.36, go to the “Hardware Implementation” tab and select
the “Pixhawk PX4” item in the pull-down menu of the “Hardware board” option.
Then, all necessary parameter setting for PSP code generation is automatically
configured.

(4). Source code compilation and firmware generation

Click the “Build” button in Fig. 3.37 to convert the Simulink controller into
C/C++ code and then compile it into the PX4 firmware. As shown in Fig. 3.38,
the code generation and compiling process can also be observed by clicking
the “Diagnostics” button on Simulink.

A successful compiling process in the
“Diagnostic Viewer” dialog is shown in Fig. 3.39, where the compiling process
is finished with the following text “Successfully generated all binary outputs”.
It can also be observed in Fig. 3.39 that a “Code Generation Report” document
will pop up after the compiling process is finished.

        Fig. 3.39 Display dialog of code generation and firmware compiling

(5). Upload PX4 firmware to Pixhawk hardware

Use the one-key upload function provided by the PSP toolbox to upload and burn
the firmware to the Pixhawk hardware. The specific steps are described below.

    1). Use a USB cable to connect the MicroUSB port (on the side of the Pixhawk
    hardware) with the USB port on the computer.

    2). As shown in Fig. 3.40, for MATLAB 2017b–2019a, click “Code”—“PX4
    PSP: Upload code to Px4FMU” on the Simulink menu bar, then the firmware
    will be automatically uploaded to the Pixhawk autopilot; for MATLAB 2019b
    and above, since the Simulink menu is deprecated, readers can input the
    “PX4Upload” command in the “Command Window” of the MATLAB interface to 
    upload the firmware .

    .. figure:: /images/Quan-ch3-Fig3.40.jpg
        :align: center

        Fig. 3.40 Firmware upload methods for different MATLAB versions

    3). Check the pop-up window carefully; sometimes, the Pixhawk autopilot has
    to be re-plugged to start the firmware uploading process.

After completing the above steps, the controller designed in Simulink has been
run on the Pixhawk autopilot.
