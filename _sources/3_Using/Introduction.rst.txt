Brief Introduction to Experimental Platforms

Platform Composition
------------------------

The experimental platform is a rapid development platform for multicopter control
algorithm design based on MATLAB/Simulink and Pixhawk. It is mainly composed
of the following five parts: the Simulink-based Controller Design and Simulation
Platform, the HIL Simulation Platform, the `Pixhawk Autopilot System <https://docs.px4.io/master/en/flight_controller/pixhawk_series.html>`_ ,
the Multicopter Hardware System, and the Instructional Package.

(1). Simulink-based Controller Design and Simulation Platform

As shown in Fig. 3.1, this platform has a high-fidelity nonlinear model for simulating 
various multicopter dynamics. Furthermore, there is an interface for communicating 
with the FlightGear simulator to provide a real-time 3D display for
the flight status (e.g., trajectory and attitude) of the simulated multicopter. 
Multicopter control algorithms can be conveniently designed on this Simulink-based
simulation platform and then verified with SIL simulations. Furthermore, the
Pixhawk Support Package (PSP) toolbox can be used to generate C/C++ code
of the control algorithms, which is then compiled and uploaded to a Pixhawk
autopilot.

(2). HIL Simulation Platform

The HIL simulation platform includes a real-time motion simulation 
software—CopterSim (see Fig. 3.2a) and a 3D visual display software—3DDisplay (see
Fig. 3.2b). The simulation model of CopterSim is obtained by importing 
parameters from the Simulink-based simulation platform mentioned earlier. Both
CopterSim and 3DDisplay must run on a computer with Windows OS (Win7
or higher, x64). They are connected with the Pixhawk autopilot through a USB
cable, thereby establishing a closed-loop control system for HIL simulations.

(3). Pixhawk Autopilot System

Figure 3.3 illustrates the entire Pixhawk autopilot system that includes a
Pixhawk autopilot, an RC transmitter, an RC receiver, and a Ground Control
Station (GCS). The Pixhawk autopilot used in this book is composed of 
Pixhawk 1 (2MB flash version) [#f2]_ autopilot hardware and PX4 autopilot software.
The PX4 autopilot software [#f3]_ has a built-in Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
to ensure basic functions, such as multi-thread scheduling, low-level drivers, and
algorithm execution. The Pixhawk autopilot uses an RC receiver to wirelessly
connect with the corresponding RC transmitter for receiving the control commands 
from the remote pilot on the ground. Further, the Pixhawk autopilot can
also wirelessly connect with GCS through a pair of radio telemetry to exchange
flight data and mission commands.

(4). Multicopter Hardware System

As shown in Fig. 3.4, a multicopter hardware system is usually composed of
an airframe system, a propulsion system, external sensors, a test stand, etc.
Combining the Pixhawk autopilot and a multicopter hardware system requires
an integrated multicopter flight platform that can be used to perform specific
flight tasks. According to the actual flight performance requirements, the 
multicopter airframe system can be designed with different configurations, such as
quadcopters, hexacopters, and coaxial octocopters. In this book, a small quadcopter 
is chosen as an example to study its hardware system design, such as
airframe design, propulsion system selection. Then, the control algorithms are
designed for the resulting multicopter hardware system.

(5). Instructional Package

This book encompasses video tutorials, PowerPoint files, and source code examples. 
The topic is closely related to our previous book [#f8]_.

Platform Advantage
----------------------

This experimental platform provides interfaces for multicopter controller design in
MATLAB/Simulink. Readers (beginners, students, or engineers) can develop a rapid
design and verify the control algorithms by SIL simulation. After the control 
algorithms are well designed and verified, the platform also provides a code generation
function to generate Simulink controllers to C/C++ code. Then, the code can be 
compiled into the autopilot software firmware file; finally, it is automatically uploaded
to the Pixhawk hardware. The platform also provides a HIL simulation platform
for preliminary simulation tests on a Pixhawk autopilot system that may help in
eliminating potential problems that may exist in flight tests. After all the tests are
completed, indoor and outdoor flight tests can be carried out by assembling the Pixhawk 
autopilot onto a real multicopter hardware system. The performance of the
designed controllers can be evaluated through experimental tests.
