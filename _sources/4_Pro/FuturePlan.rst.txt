Future Plan
=============================

RflySim provide a unified solution for development, test and assessment of unmanned control systems, and we have more wonderful features are coming soon:

1. More high-fidelity 3D scenes and vehicle models will be released on our website with control demos for users.

2. More sensors will be supported, e.g., Lidar, depth cameras.

3. Simulink interface for computer vision and machine learning, so users can train their vehicle control algorithms on RflySim

4. More types of vehicle to be supported, e.g., driverless cars, fixed-wing aircraft, VTOL, unmanned boat, etc.

5. Standard modeling module database to quickly develop vehicle model

6. More experimental courses will be released on our website
